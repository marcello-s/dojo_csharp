KataNumberConvergence: Calculate Square Root
============================================

1) Implement the simple "Heron's Method" to converge a number towards 
its square root. xn_1 = (xn + a/xn)/2.0 ; xn = (a + 1.0)/2.0
source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method
After how many iterations is the result accurate enough?

2) Try to compute the square root by multiple tasks/threads at the same time 
and print the result to console output.
Where are the problems when an instance is shared accross all tasks?
