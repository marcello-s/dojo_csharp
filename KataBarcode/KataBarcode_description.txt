KataBarcode: Image processing
=============================

This kata's goal is to implement image processing algorithms. 
The idea behind the kata is to do some kind of picture recognition, 
for instance recognition of a barcode taken from a phone camera. 
In order to get there the region of interest has to be found by converting 
and cleaning raw image data.
The actual scanning and decoding of the barcode is secondary to 
this kata.

add package:
$ dotnet add package System.Drawing.Common

1) Convert an image to grayscale:
Gray Scale = 0.3*Red + 0.59*Green + 0.11*Blue

2) Implement the kernel for 2D convolution:

3) Create a binary image:
