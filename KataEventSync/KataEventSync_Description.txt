KataEventSync: Event based Rules Engine
---------------------------------------

This Kata is about processing and synchronizing events. The idea is writing a component 
to register a rule saying when multiple events have occured send out a message that the
rule is satisfied.

Examples (just some arbitrary notation):
1) $rule1 := $event1 && $event2 && $event3
When "$event1" and "$event2" and "$event3" come true, in whatever order they occur, send message "$rule1".

2) $rule2 := $event4 || $event5
Either "$event4" or "$event5" will satisfy the rule and send "$rule2"

3) $rule3 := $rule1 && $rule2
When a rule is satisfied it may also trigger other rules simultaneously. As a result two messages
would be send: "$rule1, $rule3" or "$rule2, $rule3"

4) $rule4 := $event6(UserName == "Fred") && $event6(UserName == "Mike")
This rule is looking at properties of the event message. For instance, the message "$rule4" is send
when two messages have been sent out containing these user names.

5) $rule5 := $event7(UserName == "Fred", Online == "true") && $event7(UserName == "Mike", Online == "true")
Assuming a login/logout action sends these messages, "$rule5" should be send when two 
users are online at the same time. In this example the tricky part is replacing a previously 
sent event message: $event7(UserName == "Fred", Online == "true") followed by 
$event7(UserName == "Fred", Online == "false") would replace the previous message.


1. The plumbing component for the Kata is a publish/subscribe implementation. 
Think of a model for the messages, so that the Rules Engine can subscribe to broadcast messages.

2. How should the messages be processed? Queueing/processing in parallel
