KataMicrokernel: Type binding/resolving
=======================================

Dependency Injection (DI) frameworks offer functionality to bind 
concrete implementation types to abstract definition types. The part 
which has access to type bindings and can create instances of types 
is called a (DI) microkernel. A microkernel also contains a cache for 
objects that were declared singletons.

1) Implement a type binding registry to register a type pair. Test  
that the abstract type is assignable from the implementation type.

2) Implement the creation/instanciation of types. The constructor 
containing the most arguments should be chosen. Any dependencies must 
be resolved and instanciated. Correctly treat default values. 
For IEnumerable<T> and 'params' a list of instances should be passed.

3) Extend the type binding registry with a 'singleton' scope 
option. The microkernel should serve the same instance for these 
bindings.
