On this boardbased game tiles can be layed on a infinit board when their adjacent neighbours match.
Sides can either be part of a city or part of lawn. The tiles can be rotated to fit an opposite side.
It is possible that two joining sides are connected, meaning they are part of the same city or lawn.

1. Think of way to model the board and tiles.

2. When placing a tile next to another, check that all sides match their adjacent neighbours.
