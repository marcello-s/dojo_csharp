KataTubeMap: Route Planner 
==========================

Imagine you are a british secret agent trying to leap across London 
the fastest way possible. Of course you would use some fancy spy equipment 
of Q-ish design to assist you, or maybe just grab your phone. 
The question is, how can you make your way through London?

1) The Kata aims towards route planning algorithms. Implement the 
infrastructure code for graph nodes and edges/transitions. The infrastructure 
should support bi-directional as well as directed transitions. The nodes 
and edges must also support access to data used for decision making such 
as train stops and distances or times between stops.

2) Load a few train lines of the London Underground, or any other 
city network into the graph model.

3) Implement most common traversal algorithms, e.g. Dijkstra, Kruskal etc.

4) Find all routes from one train stop to another.

5) Find the fastest route from one train stop to another.
