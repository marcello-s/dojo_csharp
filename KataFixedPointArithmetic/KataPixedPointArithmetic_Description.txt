KataFixedPointArithmetic: Introduce a fixed point value type
============================================================

Fixed point numbers represent fractional number values with limited precision.
This data type is often used when there is no FPU available on a CPU. 
For a fixed point data type integers can be used. The MSB can be used as the sign,
and the radix point, the decimal notation, does not exist as such.

1) Implement a fixed point type as a .NET value type (struct). Clearly set the 
number range of the type. Overload +,-,*,/ binary and unary operators for 
very basic calculations.
