KataBootstrapper: a framework bootstrapper
==========================================

The idea is to boot strap a framework at early start up of a process.
This way it is possible to set up handlers or processing queues 
and bring them into your own process rather than depend on external 
services.

1) Abstract the use of an Inversion of Control (IoC) Container. Have the 
bootstrapper configure a IoC component of your choice.

2) Abstract the use of an optional logging component. Have the bootstrapper
configure a logging component of your choice. The logging abstraction will 
be used until a logging service has been registered.

3) Solve the problem of component re-composition. This means resolve 
weak depedencies of instances. Re-compose instances when these dependencies
are available in the system.
Most IoC frameworks also offer to resolve dependencies on public properties.
Compare constructure injection to property injection.
