KataHeap: a Collection of Heap Structures
=========================================

In this Kata we will be practicing data structures. Sometimes they are also 
called heaps or heap structures, because they allocate memory on the 
heap. Traditionally these structures are used to organize and access 
data items.

1) Implement a linked list. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list
Practice common operations such as Add, InsertAt, Remove, Find, Count.

2) Implement a binary tree.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree
Practice common operations such as Insert, Remove, Find, Iterate depth-first order and breadth-first order.

3) Balance a binary tree.
When keys are added in sorted order the tree becomes effectively a list. Rebuild the tree to be optimized 
for the Find operation. The algorithm is:
	- create a list of all elements (traverse breadth)
	- clear the tree
	- recursively break the list in halfs
	  - return when the lists are empty
	  - otherwise add the mid element to the tree

4) Implement a B-tree.

5) Implement a Trie
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie
Practice to store a word/annotation pair and retrieve the annotation for a given word. 
In addition retrieve all annotations for a given prefix of a word.
Note that a substring of a word will not return an annotation, for this a trie with a suffix tree 
can be implemented. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree
