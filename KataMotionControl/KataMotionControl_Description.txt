KataMotionControl: Acceleration/Speed Calculation
=================================================

For this kata there is some physics involved. You need to calculate 
acceleration ramps, speed and distance segments. In a second step the 
segments need to be aligned and adapted. The last part covers 
circular vs. linear movements.

1) A motor object contains the properties minimal and maximal 
acceleration. Calculate a distance/time segment to reach a maximal 
velocity. If possible use maximal acceleration, but if the velocity 
is reached with lower than the minimal acceleration, flag this as 
an error condition. Acceleration is constant.

2) A simple gantry robot contains 3 motors. You need to make a 
linear move between two points in 3D space, i.e. along a line. 
Adapt the segments of all 3 motors to match the slowest accelerating 
motor. All 3 motors must accelerate and drive synchronously. 
Acceleration is constant.

3) Using the X/Y motors of a gantry robot, describe a circular 
movement. Translate the segments to harmonic waves. Also accelerate 
for the circular movement.
